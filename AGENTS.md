# Repository Guidelines

## Scope and Structure

CopaLibre is a Yarn 4 TypeScript monorepo for tournament operations. Run commands from this directory. Applications live in `apps/` (`api`, `web`, `events`, workers); reusable domain and infrastructure code lives in `packages/`; operational decisions and implementation plans live in `openspec/`.

Read the active OpenSpec change before editing. Use `openspec validate <change> --strict` after updating its artifacts. Completed changes are synced and archived only after implementation and verification are complete.

## Commands

```bash
yarn install --immutable
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
yarn test
yarn test:integration
yarn test:e2e
yarn workspace @copalibre/api run openapi:generate
yarn workspace @copalibre/contracts run generate
```

Use focused commands while iterating, for example `yarn workspace @copalibre/web test --testPathPatterns 'match-console'`. Integration tests use PostgreSQL through `DATABASE_URL`; `yarn workspace @copalibre/persistence test:sqlite` is portable fast feedback, not replacement for PostgreSQL behavior.

## Code and Architecture

Use TypeScript with Prettier and ESLint. Follow existing two-space indentation, single quotes, semicolons, camelCase values, PascalCase components/classes, and nearby file naming conventions. Keep domain code framework-free: `packages/domain` and `packages/rules` must not import NestJS or Fastify.

Preserve system traceability. Mutations that affect tournament state require explicit authorization, audit records, and durable outbox events in the same transaction. Model sport behavior through `DisciplineDescriptor` data and rules; do not hardcode sport-specific UI or controller logic. Prefer UUIDs for identifiers and do not expose personal data unnecessarily.

## Tests and Contracts

Add `*.test.ts(x)` beside unit-tested code and `*.integration.test.ts` for database or HTTP behavior. Test server-side authorization and validation even when the UI hides controls. Regenerate and commit `packages/contracts/openapi/v1.json` and generated types when decorated API contracts change.

## Changes and Reviews

Use scoped Conventional Commit subjects, such as `feat(api): add match projection` or `fix(persistence): preserve elapsed clock`. Keep commits narrowly focused. PRs must describe behavior, OpenSpec change ID, tests run, migration/configuration impact, and screenshots for UI changes. Never commit `.env` files, credentials, or production connection strings.
